# 📊 Modern Data Warehouse Project

## 🚀 Project Overview  
This project focuses on building a **modern data warehouse** with a robust architecture and end-to-end data pipeline.  

### 🔹 Key Components  

#### 🏗️ Data Architecture  
- Designed using the **Medallion Architecture** with **Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers**.  
- Ensures scalability, reliability, and optimized data flow across all layers.  

#### ⚙️ ETL Pipelines  
- **Extract**: Data ingested through file parsing from multiple source systems.  
- **Transform & Load**: Batch processing using **stored procedures** to clean, standardize, and load data into the warehouse.  

#### 📐 Data Modeling  
- Developed **Fact** and **Dimension** tables to support analytical queries.  
- Optimized schema design for efficient query performance and reporting.  

#### 📊 Analytics & Reporting  
- Built **SQL-based reports** for actionable insights.
